# Socket
Heya! I'm a 13 year old programmer with interest in computer hardware, compilers, video editing and POSIX. I mostly write my code in C and Python. The irony is I'm still learning both of them and suck in both...

# Current Projects
No project lol.

# Contact Me
You, well, can contact me on discord (`socketyt`). 
You can use my emails as well (`s0cketinc@proton.me`) but the truth is, I rarely open it.
