# Current Projects
No project lol.

# My stance on software
I believe all software should give users the right to modify and hack around with it. Forks are really great, but certain types of forks that are parasitic should be avoided at all costs.

# About Me
Hey, I'm Socket. I am a student. I am fascinated with computers and programming. I am normal-new youtuber, and I am kinda good at editing. I like English too. \
I currently use Python. I love Python and nowadays write most of my stuff in it. \
I use Windows 10 as my daily driver (NixOS previously).
