# My stance on software
I believe all software should give users the right to modify and hack around with it. Forks are great, but certain types of forks that are parasitic should be avoided at all costs.

Software need not be simple, it does not need to be dumbed down to the point that it does nothing beyond it's current feature set.
Large projects (or projects intended to be large) should instead be split into smaller components to reduce code complexity.
This is never always the case, but it generally is the best way to go around doing things.

# About Me
Hey, I'm Socket. I am a student. I am fascinated with computers and programming. I like English too. \
I am a freelancer and I have worked for a Discord server with 1k members as a bot developer. (Currently not for hire) \
I currently use Nim and C++. I love Nim and nowadays write most of my stuff in it. I do use C++, but *veeery* rarely. \
I use EndeavourOS as my daily driver (NixOS previously).
