# Current Projects
No project lol.

# My stance on software
I believe all software should give users the right to modify and hack around with it. Forks are really great, but certain types of forks that are parasitic should be avoided at all costs.

Software does not need to be simple, it does not need to be dumbed down to the point that it does nothing beyond it's current feature set.
Large projects (or projects intended to be large) should instead be split into smaller components to reduce code complexity.
